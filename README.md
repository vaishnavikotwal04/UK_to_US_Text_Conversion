# UK_to_US_Text_Conversion

## Problem Statement:

Use the provided dataset to develop a black-box machine learning model that can convert text
between UK and US dialects. You are free to use any architecture to achieve this goal. The final deliverable
should be a well-documented Colab notebook containing the implementation details, training process,
justification of architectural choices, and any additional insights.


## Scope

### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation:
- Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Preprocessed the data (cleaning, tokenization, augmentation, etc.) to prepare it for training.

### 2. Model Selection & Justification:
- Chose an appropriate machine learning/deep learning architecture for dialect conversion.
- Justified the selection of the architecture used for this task.

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation:
- Implemented a training pipeline.
- Defined evaluation metrics to assess the model’s performance and validated it.
- Discussed challenges faced during the process and solutions implemented to overcome them.

### 4. Deployment & Inference:
- Developed an inference pipeline for model deployment.
- Provided sample input/output conversions to showcase successful dialect conversion.

### 5. Documentation & Explanation:
- Fully documented all steps of the process in the Google Colab notebook.
- Included inline comments and markdown explanations for clarity.
- Provided references for any pre-trained models or external resources used.

## Key Findings

- The model successfully converted UK text to US text with high accuracy.
- Transformer-based models showed the best results for text conversion.
- Several preprocessing techniques were required for optimal performance, including tokenization and augmentation.

## Potential Improvements

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models like T5 or BERT could improve performance further.
- Data augmentation techniques like back-translation could help in improving the model’s generalization.
- Exploring additional architectures like Seq2Seq or LSTMs might yield better results.

tensorflow
transformers
torch
sklearn
numpy
